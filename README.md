## 4. Data Structures

Data structures are the foundation of organizing and storing data, a key aspect of any ML workflow.

### Files:
- `21_good_function_qualities.py`: Writing clean and efficient functions.
- `22_map_function.py`: Using `map()` to apply functions to sequences.
- `23_filter_function.py`: Using `filter()` to filter data based on a condition.
- `24_zip_function.py`: Combining multiple iterables using `zip()`.
- `25_reduce_function.py`: Reducing a list into a single value using `reduce()` from `functools`.

## 5. Special Functions

These are higher-order functions that are used frequently in data processing tasks, especially in data science and ML.

### Files:
- `26_list_comprehension.py`: Creating lists in a concise and readable manner using list comprehension.
- `27_set_comprehension.py`: Set comprehension for creating sets.
- `28_dict_comprehension.py`: Creating dictionaries using comprehension for cleaner and more efficient code.
- `29_modules_and_packages.py`: Introduction to Python modules and packages, which are essential for organizing larger Python projects, including ML projects.

---

## 6. Comprehensions

List, set, and dictionary comprehensions allow you to write more concise and readable code, which is extremely useful when working with data.

---

## 7. Modules and Packages

Modules and packages help organize Python code into reusable components. In ML projects, modules can be used to manage code for data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
